Keep track of investments through the terminal
This is a terminal app that gets price data from the Yahoo Finance API and allows the user to get up to date stock information.
It also allows users to add purchases to their portfolio and keep track of their purchases.
In the future I will add the ability to keep track of sell orders and the ability to make live trades. I also want to add the ability to keep track of Crypto assets as well.
